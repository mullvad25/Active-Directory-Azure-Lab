This project is a hands-on Active Directory lab built entirely in Microsoft Azure.  
It recreates a real enterprise IT environment with a Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller.  
The goal is to demonstrate core IT support skills including domain creation, DNS, user management, RDP, and Azure VM administration.

# 🎯 Project Overview

This lab simulates a real on-premises IT environment using cloud-hosted Azure VMs.

**Completed so far:**

- Deployed a Windows Server 2025 Azure VM  
- Assigned static private IP for DC reliability  
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services  
- Promoted server to a Domain Controller  
- Created the forest/domain `lab.local`  
- Logged in using domain credentials (`lab\labadmin`)  

This environment is ideal for practising IT Support, Desktop Support, Service Desk, and junior Sysadmin tasks.

## 🗂️ Organizational Units (OUs) Created

A clean, enterprise-style OU structure was created:

- **_Admins**
- **_Users**
- **_Groups**
- **_Computers**
- **_Departments**
  - IT
  - HR
  - Finance
  - Sales
  - Operations

📸 *OU Structure:*

# 📌 Phase 3 — Department File Shares and NTFS Security (Completed)

Phase 3 introduces enterprise-style file sharing and NTFS permission design.  
Each department receives a secure folder and access is granted strictly through AD security groups.  
This demonstrates help desk and junior sysadmin skills including least privilege access control and permissions troubleshooting.

---

## 🗂️ Department Shares Created

A shared root directory was created on the Domain Controller.

C drive folder location:
    C:\Shares

Folder structure:
    C:\Shares
        IT
        HR
        Finance
        Sales
        Operations

📸 Folder structure  
![Shares Folder Structure](./Screenshots/SharesFolderStructure.PNG)

---

## 👥 Active Directory Security Groups Created

Each department received a dedicated security group used for access control:

- IT_Staff_Members  
- HR_Staff_Members  
- Finance_Staff_Members  
- Sales_Staff_Members  
- Operations_Staff_Members  

📸 Group list

## 🔐 NTFS Permission Configuration

Key NTFS rules applied:
- Removed Authenticated Users  
- Granted Modify permissions to the correct department group  
- Domain Admins and SYSTEM keep Full Control  
- NTFS permissions control access rather than share permissions  
- Implements RBAC (Role Based Access Control)
