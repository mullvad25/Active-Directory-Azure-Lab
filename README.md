This project is a hands-on Active Directory lab built entirely in Microsoft Azure.  
It recreates a real enterprise IT environment with a Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller.  
The goal is to demonstrate core IT support skills including domain creation, DNS, user management, RDP, and Azure VM administration.

# 🎯 Project Overview

This lab simulates a real on-premises IT environment using cloud-hosted Azure VMs.

**Completed so far:**

- Deployed a Windows Server 2025 Azure VM  
- Assigned static private IP for DC reliability  
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services  
- Promoted server to a Domain Controller  
- Created the forest/domain `lab.local`  
- Logged in using domain credentials (`lab\labadmin`)  

This environment is ideal for practising IT Support, Desktop Support, Service Desk, and junior Sysadmin tasks.

# 📌 Phase 2 — Active Directory Foundation Completed 

Phase 2 establishes the core Active Directory environment inside `lab.local`.  
This includes departments, users, admin accounts, service accounts, onboarding accounts, RDP permissions, and domain-level security policies.

---

## 🗂️ Organizational Units (OUs) Created

A clean, enterprise-style OU structure was created:

- **_Admins**
- **_Users**
- **_Groups**
- **_Computers**
- **_Departments**
  - IT
  - HR
  - Finance
  - Sales
  - Operations

📸 *OU Structure:*  
![OU Structure](Screenshots/Full%20OU%20Structure.PNG)

### ✔ Added to Remote Desktop Users  
- `locktest` added to the **Remote Desktop Users** local group  

### ✔ Updated Local Security Policy  
- Confirmed Remote Desktop Users has RDP logon rights  

---

## 🔄 Account Lockout Policy (Domain Security)

Configured via **Default Domain Policy**:

# 📌 Phase 3 — Department File Shares and NTFS Security (Completed)

Phase 3 introduces enterprise-style file sharing and NTFS permission design.  
Each department receives a secure folder and access is granted strictly through AD security groups.  
This demonstrates help desk and junior sysadmin skills including least privilege access control and permissions troubleshooting.

---

## 🗂️ Department Shares Created

A shared root directory was created on the Domain Controller.

C drive folder location:
    C:\Shares

Folder structure:
    C:\Shares
        IT
        HR
        Finance
        Sales
        Operations

📸 Folder structure

## 👥 Active Directory Security Groups Created

Each department received a dedicated security group used for access control:

- IT_Staff_Members  
- HR_Staff_Members  
- Finance_Staff_Members  
- Sales_Staff_Members  
- Operations_Staff_Members  

📸 Group list

## 🔐 NTFS Permission Configuration

Key NTFS rules applied:
- Removed Authenticated Users  
- Granted Modify permissions to the correct department group  
- Domain Admins and SYSTEM keep Full Control  
- NTFS permissions control access rather than share permissions  
- Implements RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

| Folder | Expected | Result |
|--------|----------|--------|
| IT | Allowed | ✔ Confirmed |
| HR | Denied | ✔ Confirmed |
| Finance | Denied | Not tested |
| Sales | Denied | Not tested |
| Operations | Denied | Not tested |
