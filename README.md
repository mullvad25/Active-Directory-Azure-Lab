This project is a hands-on Active Directory lab built entirely in Microsoft Azure.  
It recreates a real enterprise IT environment with a Windows Server 2025 Domain Controller.  
The goal is to demonstrate core IT support skills including domain creation, DNS, user management, RDP, and Azure VM administration.

# 🎯 Project Overview

This lab simulates a real on-premises IT environment using cloud-hosted Azure VMs.

**Completed so far:**

- Deployed a Windows Server 2025 Azure VM  
- Assigned static private IP for DC reliability  
- Installed Active Directory Domain Services  
- Promoted server to a Domain Controller  
- Created the forest/domain `lab.local`  
- Logged in using domain credentials (`lab\labadmin`)  

This environment is ideal for practising IT Support, Desktop Support, Service Desk, and junior Sysadmin tasks.
